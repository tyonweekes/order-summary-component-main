## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS variables
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

On top of more CSS positioning practice, I learned how to incorporate a design element into the background. I also learned how to close up a gap between an image and a div (even when padding and margins are set to 0). Just use display: block on the image.

### Continued development

I want to continue developing in JavaScript, and finding the most efficient solutions for that and CSS.
